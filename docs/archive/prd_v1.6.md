# Product Requirements Document: AI Project Architect Pro 1 (AIPAP1)

**Version:** 1.6
**Date:** June 11, 2025
**Author:** PAP1 (Project Architect Pro AI) & User
**Status:** Final - For AIPAP1 v1.0

## 1. Document Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for the "AI Project Architect Pro 1" (referred to as "the Application" or "AIPAP1") Version 1.0. AIPAP1 is a software application designed to guide a user from a nascent project idea through to a fully planned and actionable development backlog, and to provide ongoing AI-powered support during the development lifecycle. It leverages AI to facilitate requirements gathering, define foundational project aspects (tech stack, UI/UX vision), structure Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), automate task breakdown, and act as a project-specific intelligence layer for developers.

## 2. Executive Summary

The AI Project Architect Pro 1 aims to revolutionize the entire software project lifecycle by addressing common inefficiencies from planning to execution. Many organizations struggle with inconsistent project planning and a loss of context once development begins, leading to misalignments, delays, and duplicated effort.

AIPAP1's vision is a three-stage solution:
1.  **Plan (Wizard):** A **PRD Authoring Assistant** interactively guides users through creating a thorough, well-structured PRD, including the definition of technology stack and UI/UX vision. It produces a sharable, web-accessible final document.
2.  **Deconstruct (Agent):** A **PRD-to-Task Automation Agent** ingests the rich PRD and intelligently breaks it down into a comprehensive, hierarchical set of development tasks, including practical setup files like `.env.example`. These tasks can be synced to platforms like Azure DevOps and GitHub.
3.  **Support (Dev Assistant):** A future **AI Development Assistant** will act as an interactive "project brain," providing ongoing, contextual answers and analysis during active development to maintain alignment with the original plan.

For AIPAP1 v1.0, the focus is on the "Plan" and "Deconstruct" stages. The primary benefits include accelerated project initiation, radically improved clarity of requirements and design intent, reduced manual effort, and a robust, traceable link between product vision and development execution.

## 3. Problem Statement

*   **Ambiguous Requirements:** Difficulty translating high-level needs into actionable specifics.
*   **Inconsistent PRDs:** Variable quality makes planning documents hard to act upon.
*   **Time-Consuming Task Breakdown:** Manual WBS creation is a major bottleneck.
*   **Context Decay:** Original project intent is often lost once development starts.
*   **Feedback Loop Gaps:** Reviewing artifacts against requirements is a manual, asynchronous process.
*   **Onboarding Inefficiency:** New team members spend excessive time finding the project's "source of truth."
*   **Developer Setup Friction:** Developers often guess at required environment variables and initial configuration.

## 4. Goals & Objectives

*   **Goal 1:** Establish a standardized and AI-guided process for comprehensive project definition and communication.
    *   **Objective 1.1:** Develop the **Wizard** module to guide users through creating detailed, AI-optimized PRDs containing all critical technical, functional, and UI/UX definitions.
    *   **Objective 1.2:** Enable easy sharing of the finalized PRD with all project stakeholders via a read-only web link.
*   **Goal 2:** Automate the creation of a clear and practical development plan.
    *   **Objective 2.1:** Develop the **Agent** module to intelligently parse the rich PRD and generate a hierarchical set of SDLC tasks, including practical setup details like environment variable templates.
    *   **Objective 2.2:** For v1.0, enable direct integration with Azure DevOps/GitHub for task creation, or an offline export option.
*   **Goal 3:** Create a persistent, interactive knowledge base to support active development (The Long-Term Vision for Post-v1.0).
    *   **Objective 3.1:** (Future) Develop the **Dev Assistant** module to act as a conversational interface to the project's "brain."

## 5. Target Audience/Users

*   **Primary User (Initiator):** Product Managers, Project Managers, Business Analysts, lead developers involved in project planning.
*   **Secondary User (Developer/Implementer):** Developers (human or AI) who consume the generated tasks and setup files.
*   **Tertiary User (Stakeholder):** Team members, clients, or executives who view the shared PRD for context and alignment.

## 6. Proposed Solution Overview

AIPAP1 is a web-based application envisioned with a project management layer and three core AI modules:

*   **Module 1 (Wizard - Plan):** Guides PRD creation, including definition of tech stack and UI/UX Vision. Produces a final, sharable Markdown PRD.
*   **Module 2 (Agent - Deconstruct):** Ingests the PRD. Parses requirements and generates a complete, hierarchical task list, including helper configurations. Syncs to DevOps tools or exports.
*   **Module 3 (Dev Assistant - Support - Future Vision):** A conversational AI layer for ongoing development support.
