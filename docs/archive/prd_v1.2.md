# Product Requirements Document: AI Project Architect Pro

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** June 11, 2025
**Author:** PAP1 (Project Architect Pro AI) & User
**Status:** Final Draft for Current Phase

## 1. Document Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for the "AI Project Architect Pro" (referred to as "the Application" or "AIPAP1"). AIPAP1 is a software application designed to assist users in transforming nascent project ideas into detailed, actionable software development plans, culminating in tasks ready for popular DevOps platforms. It leverages AI to guide requirements gathering, structure Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), and automate the breakdown of these PRDs into comprehensive development tasks.

## 2. Executive Summary

The AI Project Architect Pro aims to revolutionize the initial phases of software development by addressing common inefficiencies in requirements gathering, PRD creation, and task definition. Many organizations, particularly those with nascent DevOps practices, struggle with manual, inconsistent, and often incomplete project planning. This leads to extended development timelines, unclear objectives, and wasted effort.

AIPAP1 offers a two-pronged AI-powered solution:
1.  A **PRD Authoring Assistant (The "Wizard")** that interactively guides users through creating a thorough, well-structured, and AI-optimized PRD.
2.  A **PRD-to-Task Automation Agent (The "Agent")** that ingests the generated PRD and intelligently breaks it down into a comprehensive, hierarchical set of development tasks, including SDLC scaffolding, suitable for platforms like Azure DevOps and GitHub.

The system will also provide project management capabilities to handle multiple projects, configuration settings for personalization, and valuable outputs like an executive-level project overview. The primary benefits include accelerated project initiation, improved task clarity, reduced manual effort, and better alignment between product vision and development execution.

## 3. Problem Statement

Current challenges in software project initiation include:
*   **Lack of DevOps Practices:** Many teams operate with manual, ad-hoc processes for development, relying on informal documentation (e.g., basic text files, emails) leading to a lack of transparency and efficiency.
*   **Ambiguous Requirements:** Users and stakeholders often struggle to articulate clear, complete, and testable requirements. They may "know what they need" at a high level but not how to translate that into actionable development specifics.
*   **Inconsistent PRDs:** The quality and structure of PRDs vary wildly, making them difficult for development teams to parse and act upon consistently.
*   **Time-Consuming Task Breakdown:** Manually translating a PRD into a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) with epics, user stories, tasks, and sub-tasks is labor-intensive and prone to omissions.
*   **Knowledge Gaps:** Project initiators may lack awareness of crucial non-functional requirements (e.g., security, compliance, performance) or software development best practices.
*   **Scalability Issues:** Managing and initiating multiple projects (e.g., 30+) with these manual methods is highly inefficient and error-prone.

## 4. Goals & Objectives

*   **Goal 1:** Establish a standardized, efficient, and AI-guided process for requirements gathering and PRD creation.
    *   **Objective 1.1:** Develop an interactive "Wizard" module that guides users through creating comprehensive, AI-optimized PRDs.
    *   **Objective 1.2:** Ensure PRDs generated by the Wizard are well-structured and contain necessary details like user stories, acceptance criteria, and technology stack definitions.
*   **Goal 2:** Automate the translation of PRDs into well-defined, actionable development tasks.
    *   **Objective 2.1:** Develop an "Agent" module capable of parsing PRDs and generating a hierarchical set of SDLC scaffolding tasks and feature-specific development tasks, including detailed sub-tasks.
    *   **Objective 2.2:** Enable direct integration with Azure DevOps and GitHub for task creation, or an offline export option.
*   **Goal 3:** Improve project outcomes through enhanced clarity, reduced manual effort, and faster initiation.
    *   **Objective 3.1:** Reduce the time spent on manually creating PRDs and breaking them down into tasks.
    *   **Objective 3.2:** Increase the clarity and completeness of tasks provided to development teams.
    *   **Objective 3.3:** Provide users with foresight and control over task generation through preview and confirmation steps.
*   **Goal 4:** Empower users with better project definition and oversight capabilities.
    *   **Objective 4.1:** Implement basic project management features for handling multiple projects within the application.
    *   **Objective 4.2:** Generate an executive-level project overview document for stakeholder communication.

## 5. Target Audience/Users

*   **Primary User (Initiator):** Individuals responsible for initial project definition, requirements gathering, and potentially overseeing multiple software projects (e.g., Product Managers, Project Managers, Business Analysts, experienced developers taking on planning roles). This user will directly interact with the Wizard and Agent.
*   **Stakeholders (Indirect Beneficiaries):** Development teams who will consume the generated tasks, and executives/clients who will benefit from clearer project plans and the executive brief.

## 6. Proposed Solution Overview

The AI Project Architect Pro will be a web-based application consisting of a central project management layer and two core AI-powered modules:

*   **Project Management Layer:** Provides functionality to create, organize, and manage multiple software projects. Each project will have its associated PRD, configurations, and generated task plans.
*   **Module 1: PRD Authoring Assistant (The "Wizard"):** An interactive, AI-driven module that guides users through the process of creating a high-quality, structured PRD in Markdown format. It uses templates, prompts, intelligent suggestions, and can ingest existing documentation for context.
*   **Module 2: PRD-to-Task Automation Agent (The "Agent"):** An AI-powered module that ingests the PRD created by the Wizard. It parses the PRD to understand requirements, features, NFRs, and the defined technology stack. It then generates a comprehensive, hierarchical set of development tasks—from foundational SDLC setup (repo, CI/CD stubs) through feature implementation tasks with detailed instructions and test strategies, including intelligent sub-task breakdown—and can sync these tasks to Azure DevOps or GitHub, or provide an offline export.

    *   Generates an initial set of **high-level tasks** (Epics/Features) covering:
        *   **Phase A (Project Foundation)** tasks (repo, structure, CI/CD stubs, testing framework) based on defined tech stack.
        *   **Phase B (Architecture & Design)** tasks (data model, high-level architecture) inferred from PRD features and NFRs.
        *   **Phase C (Feature Development)**: Maps PRD features/user stories to initial high-level DevOps work items.
        *   **Phase D (Cross-Cutting Concern)** tasks (security, performance) from NFRs.
    *   Performs **complexity analysis** on these generated high-level tasks to determine recommended sub-task depth and to generate specific, context-aware "expansion prompts" for guiding further LLM-based breakdown of each high-level task.
    *   Uses these tailored "expansion prompts" to iteratively **generate detailed sub-tasks** for each high-level task. This breakdown respects the analyzed complexity and user-defined granularity preferences (from CFG-AGENT-004). Sub-tasks for Feature Development will further detail the implementation (backend, frontend, logic, tests) linked to PRD ACs and NFRs.
*   **AGENT-CORE-004: Comprehensive Task Property & Instruction Generation:**
    *   For each high-level task and all generated sub-tasks: assigns ID, Status, Priority, Dependencies, Tags.
    *   Generates clear Title, Description.

    *   Defines a "Test Strategy" field with verification steps, referencing PRD ACs.
*   **AGENT-CORE-005: DevOps/GitHub Integration:**
    *   Connects to configured platform. Creates/updates work items according to defined hierarchy and mappings.
*   **AGENT-CORE-006: Offline Task List Export:**
    *   Option to export the generated task breakdown as a structured file (JSON, Markdown, or CSV).
*   **AGENT-CORE-007: PRD Versioning Management (MVP - Initial Generation & Warned Re-generation):**
    *   Handles initial task generation. For subsequent PRD versions, offers re-generation, warning user about potential impacts on existing work items in DevOps.
*   **AGENT-CORE-008: Task Generation Preview & Confirmation:**
    *   Before syncing/exporting, presents a preview of the full generated task hierarchy (including sub-tasks) and details.
    *   User reviews for accuracy and completeness.
    *   Upon approval, a summary of actions (e.g., number of tasks to be created) is shown before final execution.
*   **AGENT-CORE-009: Incorporate Development Standards into Task Details:**
    *   Integrates predefined core development standards (clean code, comments) and tech-stack specific guidelines (responsive design, secure APIs, test coverage) into relevant task/sub-task instructions.
    *   Allows PRD-defined custom standards to influence task details.

### 7.4. Key Output Features

*   **AGENT-OUTPUT-001: Project Overview & Plan Document (Executive Brief):**
    *   Generates a non-technical summary document outlining project scope, goals, technology, high-level plan, and how to track progress. Formatted for executive readability (e.g., PDF/Markdown).

## 8. User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI) Considerations

*   **Intuitive & Guided:** The UI should be clean, intuitive, and strongly guide the user, especially within the Wizard. Assume users may not be expert requirements analysts.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Avoid overwhelming users. Reveal complexity or advanced options as needed.
*   **Clear Feedback & Status:** Provide clear feedback on AI actions, processing status, and outcomes of operations.
*   **Control & Transparency:** Users should feel in control (e.g., via the task preview). AI suggestions should be clearly marked.
*   **Modularity in UI:** The UI should reflect the modular structure (Project Management, Wizard, Agent).
*   **Responsiveness:** The application should be responsive for standard desktop screen sizes.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Usability:** High priority. The system must be easy to learn and use for the target audience.
*   **Reliability:** The system must reliably generate PRDs and tasks, and integrate with DevOps platforms without data loss.
*   **Performance:** PRD parsing and task generation should occur within acceptable timeframes (e.g., a few minutes for a moderately complex PRD). Large document uploads and processing should also be performant.
*   **Security (for user data & API keys):** User API keys and any sensitive PRD information must be stored and handled securely. Connections to DevOps platforms must use secure authentication.
*   **Scalability (Basic):** The system should handle a reasonable number of concurrent users (e.g., a small team) and manage data for tens to hundreds of projects per user/organization.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure that the data translated from PRD to tasks maintains accuracy and that relationships (like dependencies) are correctly established.

## 10. Technical Considerations/Assumptions

*   **Core AI Technology:** Relies on access to powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) via user-provided API keys (e.g., OpenAI GPT series, Anthropic Claude series).
*   **PRD Format:** The canonical PRD format generated and consumed internally (especially between Wizard and Agent) will be structured Markdown.
*   **DevOps Integration:** Initial focus on Azure DevOps and GitHub. Authentication will likely be OAuth-based.
*   **Web-Based Application:** Assumed to be a centrally hosted web application.
*   **Programming Language/Framework:** To be determined, but should support robust backend processing for AI interactions and good frontend user experience.

## 11. Success Metrics (KPIs)

*   **User Adoption Rate:** Number of active users/projects created.
*   **Task Completion/PRD Generation Time:** Average time taken by users to complete a PRD using the Wizard, and by the Agent to generate tasks.
*   **Quality of Generated Tasks:** User satisfaction surveys, error rates in generated tasks (measured by how often users need to heavily edit them post-generation).
*   **Reduction in Manual Effort:** (Self-reported by users) Time saved compared to manual PRD/task creation.
*   **Feature Usage:** Metrics on usage of key features like "Quick Draft," "AI Autofill," "Executive Brief generation."
*   **PRD Standardization:** Increased consistency in PRDs across projects for a given user/organization.

## 12. Out of Scope (For Initial Version/MVP)

*   **Actual AI Code Generation/Execution:** The system generates *tasks* and *plans*, not executable code.
*   **Real-time Collaborative PRD Editing:** Initial focus is on a single primary user for PRD authoring per session.
*   **Advanced Bi-directional Sync with DevOps:** Full synchronization of status updates *from* DevOps back *into* AIPAP1's project status (AP-PM-003 is manual for AIPAP1 status). MVP is primarily one-way: AIPAP1 to DevOps.
*   **Automated PRD/Task Updates from Code Changes:** The system does not monitor repositories for code changes to suggest PRD updates.
*   **Direct Microsoft Teams Project Setup Integration:** While a desired future feature, direct MS Teams integration for project setup is out of scope for MVP.
*   **Deep AI-driven Task Estimation:** While basic complexity categories might be assigned, precise AI-driven time/effort estimation for tasks is a complex area and out of MVP scope.
*   **Fully Dynamic AI Rule Creation for Task Generation:** The Agent will use predefined and PRD-stated rules, not autonomously create new, complex development rules from scratch during task generation.

## 13. Open Questions/Future Considerations

*   **Granularity of User Permissions/Roles within AIPAP1:** (Beyond the primary user).
*   **Support for other DevOps/Project Management Tools:** (e.g., Jira, Trello, Asana).
*   **Advanced Analytics/Reporting on project progress/bottlenecks (if bi-directional sync is implemented).**
*   **Community Templates for PRDs or Task Structures.**
*   **Direct integration with diagramming or wireframing tools.**
*   **The "AI-to-AI Programmer Agent" dream:** How this system could provide even more structured input for fully automated coding agents in the future.
*   **Ethical considerations of AI making project decisions and long-term maintenance of AI-generated project plans.**

## 14. Living Document Disclaimer

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a living document. It is expected to evolve as the project progresses, and new insights are gained through development, testing, and user feedback. All stakeholders will be notified of significant changes.
