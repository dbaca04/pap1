# Product Requirements Document: AI Project Architect Pro

**Version:** 1.5
**Date:** June 11, 2025
**Author:** PAP1 (Project Architect Pro AI) & User
**Status:** Final Draft for Current Phase

## 1. Document Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for the "AI Project Architect Pro" (referred to as "the Application" or "AIPAP1"). AIPAP1 is a software application designed to guide a user from a nascent project idea through to a fully planned and actionable development backlog, and to provide ongoing AI-powered support during the development lifecycle. It leverages AI to facilitate requirements gathering, define foundational project aspects (tech stack, UI/UX vision), structure Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), automate task breakdown, and act as a project-specific intelligence layer for developers.

## 2. Executive Summary

The AI Project Architect Pro aims to revolutionize the entire software project lifecycle by addressing common inefficiencies from planning to execution. Many organizations struggle with inconsistent project planning and a loss of context once development begins, leading to misalignments, delays, and duplicated effort.

AIPAP1's vision is a three-stage solution:
1.  **Plan (Wizard):** A **PRD Authoring Assistant** interactively guides users through creating a thorough, well-structured PRD, including the definition of technology stack and UI/UX vision.
2.  **Deconstruct (Agent):** A **PRD-to-Task Automation Agent** ingests the rich PRD and intelligently breaks it down into a comprehensive, hierarchical set of development tasks suitable for platforms like Azure DevOps and GitHub.
3.  **Support (Dev Assistant):** A future **AI Development Assistant** will act as an interactive "project brain," providing ongoing, contextual answers and analysis during active development to maintain alignment with the original plan.

For the initial version (MVP), the focus is on the "Plan" and "Deconstruct" stages. The primary benefits include accelerated project initiation, radically improved clarity of requirements and design intent, reduced manual effort, and a robust, traceable link between product vision and development execution.

## 3. Problem Statement

*   **Ambiguous Requirements:** Stakeholders often struggle to articulate clear, testable requirements, including foundational choices like technology stack or UI/UX direction.
*   **Inconsistent PRDs:** The quality and structure of planning documents vary wildly, making them difficult for teams to parse consistently.
*   **Time-Consuming Task Breakdown:** Manually translating a PRD into a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) is labor-intensive, error-prone, and a major bottleneck.
*   **Context Decay:** Once development starts, the original context and nuances of the PRD are often lost. Developers lack a quick way to get authoritative answers to clarifying questions.
*   **Feedback Loop Gaps:** Reviewing development artifacts (like mockups or code) against original requirements is a manual, asynchronous process.
*   **Onboarding Inefficiency:** New team members spend excessive time trying to piece together the project's history and intent.

## 4. Goals & Objectives

*   **Goal 1:** Establish a standardized and AI-guided process for comprehensive project definition.
    *   **Objective 1.1:** Develop the **Wizard** module to guide users through creating detailed, AI-optimized PRDs containing all critical technical, functional, and UI/UX definitions.
*   **Goal 2:** Automate the creation of a clear, actionable development plan from the defined project.
    *   **Objective 2.1:** Develop the **Agent** module to intelligently parse the rich PRD and generate a hierarchical set of SDLC tasks tailored to the defined stack and vision.
    *   **Objective 2.2:** For MVP, enable direct integration with Azure DevOps/GitHub for task creation, or an offline export option.
*   **Goal 3:** Create a persistent, interactive knowledge base to support active development (The Long-Term Vision).
    *   **Objective 3.1:** (Future) Develop the **Dev Assistant** module to act as a conversational interface to the project's "brain" (the PRD and task plan).
    *   **Objective 3.2:** (Future) Enable developers to ask questions, log discussions, and get AI-powered feedback on development artifacts.

## 5. Target Audience/Users

*   **Primary User (Initiator):** Product Managers, Project Managers, Business Analysts, lead developers involved in project planning.
*   **Secondary User (Developer/Implementer):** Developers (human or AI) who consume the generated tasks and (in the future) will interact with the Dev Assistant for clarification and guidance.
*   **Indirect Beneficiaries:** Designers (getting better initial direction), executives (clearer plans and reporting).

## 6. Proposed Solution Overview

AIPAP1 is a web-based application envisioned with a project management layer and three core AI modules that cover the project lifecycle:

*   **Project Management Layer:** Manages multiple projects, each with its PRD, configs, and task plans.
*   **Module 1 (Wizard - Plan):** Interactively guides PRD creation. Facilitates the definition of technology stack and a comprehensive UI/UX Vision (theme, flows, principles). Can ingest existing documents.
*   **Module 2 (Agent - Deconstruct):** Ingests the Wizard's PRD. Parses requirements and generates a complete, hierarchical set of development tasks with detailed instructions, syncing them to Azure DevOps/GitHub or providing an export.
*   **Module 3 (Dev Assistant - Support - Future Vision):** A conversational AI layer built on top of the finalized PRD and task list. Developers can query this "project brain" for context, clarification, and feedback during development.

## 8. User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI) Considerations

*   **"Intelligent Blueprint" Theme:** The application's UI will be clean, structured, professional, and modern, inspiring confidence and clarity. It will utilize a consistent color palette, typography, and iconography.
*   **Layout Framework:** Employs a dynamic layout (two-part for global views, three-part for project workspaces) with a persistent top header and contextual sidebars.
*   **Interaction Design:** Utilizes standard UI patterns like dropdowns, modals for critical actions, pop-out sidebars for contextual info, and non-intrusive "toast" notifications for feedback.
*   **Mobile Design (for MVP):** Responsive, with a view-first focus. Complex authoring is a secondary concern. The UI adapts navigation and content for smaller screens and touch interaction.
*   **Wizard's Role in Defining Initial UX (Enhanced):** F-WIZ-013 is a core feature for capturing the user's intended aesthetic, key flows, and principles for the application they are defining.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Usability, Reliability, Performance, Security (critically for API keys), Scalability (Basic), Data Integrity.**

## 10. Technical Considerations/Assumptions

*   **Core AI Technology:** Relies on access to powerful LLMs via user-provided API keys.
*   **PRD Format:** Structured Markdown, including explicit sections for UI/UX Vision and Technology Stack.
*   **DevOps Integration:** Azure DevOps and GitHub initially.
*   **Web-Based Application.**
*   **Programming Language/Framework:** TBD.

## 11. Success Metrics (KPIs)

*   **User Adoption Rate, Task/PRD Generation Time, Quality of Generated Tasks, Reduction in Manual Effort, Feature Usage.**
*   (Future) **Engagement with Dev Assistant:** Number of queries, user satisfaction with answers.

## 12. Out of Scope (For Initial Version/MVP)

*   **Module 3: The AI Development Assistant:** All features (DA-001, DA-002, DA-003, DA-004) are out of scope for the initial release and are part of the future vision.
*   **Visual Mockup/Wireframe Generation by AIPAP1:** AIPAP1 captures textual/conceptual UI/UX descriptions; it does not generate graphical mockups.
*   **Actual AI Code Generation/Execution.**
*   **Real-time Collaborative PRD Editing.**
*   **Advanced Bi-directional Sync with DevOps.**
*   **Direct Microsoft Teams Project Setup Integration.**
*   **Deep AI-driven Task Estimation.**

## 13. Open Questions/Future Considerations

*   **Evolution to Module 3:** The primary future direction is the planning and implementation of the "AI Development Assistant."
*   **Visual Mockup/Wireframe Integration:** Allow users to upload or link to visual mockups within the Wizard's UI/UX section.
*   **Enhanced AI Assistance:** Suggesting entire sections (Goals, Features) based on a simple project description.
*   **Broader DevOps/PM Tool Support:** Integration with Jira, Trello, Asana, etc.
