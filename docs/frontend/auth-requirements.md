# User Authentication Flow Requirements

This document outlines the frontend components and general areas of the AIPAP1 application that are intended to be "protected" and would require an authenticated user session in a production environment with a backend handling user accounts.

## General Principle

The entire AIPAP1 application, beyond a potential public landing or login page (which is not part of the current single `index.html` structure), is designed for use by an authenticated user. All data (projects, PRDs, tasks, settings) is implicitly user-specific.

## Protected Components/Routes/Views

The following components and the functionalities they provide should be considered protected and accessible only after successful user authentication:

1.  **`ProjectDashboard.tsx` (Path: effectively `/` or `/dashboard`)**
    *   **Functionality:** Listing user's projects, creating new projects, editing project details, archiving/deleting projects.
    *   **Reason:** All project data is user-owned.

2.  **`ProjectWorkspace.tsx` (Path: effectively dynamic, representing an active project view)**
    *   This component acts as a container for project-specific tools. Access to any active project implies authentication.
    *   **Sub-components/views within `ProjectWorkspace` are also protected:**
        *   **`PRDWizard.tsx` (Tab: "PRD Wizard")**
            *   **Functionality:** Creating, editing, and managing all aspects of a Product Requirements Document for the active project. AI-assisted content generation for PRD sections.
            *   **Reason:** PRD content is sensitive project IP.
        *   **`TaskAgent.tsx` (Tab: "Task Agent")**
            *   **Functionality:** Analyzing PRDs, generating hierarchical project tasks, viewing/exporting tasks, generating executive briefs. AI-assisted task generation.
            *   **Reason:** Task lists are derived from project IP and are part of project planning.
        *   **"Project Settings" Tab (Future)**
            *   **Functionality:** Managing settings specific to the active project (e.g., integrations, team members - if added).
            *   **Reason:** Project-specific configurations.

3.  **`SettingsModal.tsx` (Accessed via global settings icon)**
    *   **Functionality:** Managing global user preferences (DevOps platform, task granularity, theme).
    *   **Reason:** These are user-specific settings.

4.  **`RightSidebar.tsx` (Contextual Panel)**
    *   **Functionality:** Live PRD Preview, AI Assistant tips.
    *   **Reason:** Operates in the context of an active, protected project.

## Public vs. Private

*   **Private:** Essentially the entire current application functionality as described above.
*   **Public (Hypothetical):** If the application were to expand, potential public areas might include:
    *   A landing page explaining AIPAP1.
    *   A login/registration page.
    *   Publicly shared (read-only) project views (not a current feature).

## Backend Implication

The backend team should ensure that API endpoints corresponding to the functionalities listed above are protected by robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT-based auth). API requests to these endpoints must be validated to ensure they originate from an authenticated user who has the necessary permissions for the requested resource (e.g., a user can only access their own projects).
