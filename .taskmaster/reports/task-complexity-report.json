      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Backend Foundation' task into detailed subtasks covering database setup, user authentication (registration, login, JWT), secure key storage implementation, and API endpoint development, including specific testing requirements for each.",
      "reasoning": "This task is foundational and critical. It involves multiple complex and security-sensitive components: robust authentication (Passport.js, JWT), database schema design and migration, and secure encryption/decryption for sensitive data. Errors here can compromise the entire application."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for 'Implement Multi-Project Management', separating frontend UI components (dashboard, create modal, workspace) from backend API development (CRUD operations) and outlining the integration and testing steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves full-stack development (frontend UI with state management, backend CRUD APIs) for a core feature. It requires careful coordination between frontend and backend, and robust error handling."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for 'Implement 'Quick Draft' and Template-Based Authoring Aids', covering the backend quick draft generation endpoint, frontend UI for quick draft, and the implementation of template insertion buttons for user stories and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task introduces basic content generation and templating. It involves both frontend UI elements and a new backend endpoint, but the logic is primarily rule-based rather than complex AI integration."

      "taskTitle": "Task Preview UI and Offline Export (F-AGENT4)",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Task Preview UI and Offline Export' into subtasks, covering the backend endpoint to trigger task generation, the frontend UI component for hierarchical task display, and the client-side implementation for JSON and Markdown export functionalities.",
      "reasoning": "This task ties together the agent's output with the user interface and provides a key deliverable (offline export). Displaying hierarchical data and implementing client-side file generation and formatting adds complexity."
