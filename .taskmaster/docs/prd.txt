# Product Requirements Document: AI Project Architect Pro

**Version:** 1.7
**Date:** June 11, 2025
**Author:** PAP1 (Project Architect Pro AI) & User
**Status:** Final - For AIPAP1 v1.0 Development

## 1. Document Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for the "AI Project Architect Pro" (referred to as "the Application" or "AIPAP1") Version 1.0. AIPAP1 is a comprehensive software application designed to guide a user from a nascent project idea through to a fully planned and actionable development backlog. It leverages AI to facilitate requirements gathering, define foundational project aspects (tech stack, UI/UX vision), structure Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), automate task breakdown, and serve as a knowledge base for development.

## 2. Executive Summary

The AI Project Architect Pro (AIPAP1) aims to revolutionize the entire software project lifecycle by addressing common inefficiencies from planning to execution. AIPAP1 provides a structured, AI-enhanced environment to transform abstract ideas into concrete development plans.

The application's vision encompasses three stages, with v1.0 focusing on the first two:
1.  **Plan (Wizard):** The **PRD Authoring Assistant** interactively guides users through creating a detailed PRD, including definitions for the technology stack and UI/UX vision. The final PRD is a sharable web document.
2.  **Deconstruct (Agent):** The **PRD-to-Task Automation Agent** ingests the PRD and intelligently generates a hierarchical set of development tasks, complete with practical setup files (e.g., `.env.example`), ready for sync with DevOps platforms like Azure DevOps and GitHub.
3.  **Support (Dev Assistant - Future Vision):** A future **AI Development Assistant** will act as an interactive "project brain," providing ongoing, contextual answers and analysis during active development.

The primary benefits for v1.0 include accelerated project initiation, radically improved clarity of requirements and design intent, reduced manual effort, and a robust, traceable link between product vision and development execution.

## 3. Problem Statement

*   **Ambiguous Requirements:** Stakeholders struggle to translate high-level needs into actionable specifics, including crucial early design and technical direction.
*   **Inconsistent PRDs:** The quality and structure of planning documents vary wildly, making them hard for teams to act upon.
*   **Time-Consuming Task Breakdown:** Manually creating a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a major bottleneck.
*   **Context Decay:** Original project intent is often lost once development begins, leading to a lack of a "source of truth."
*   **Onboarding Inefficiency:** New team members spend excessive time trying to understand a project's history and requirements.
*   **Developer Setup Friction:** Developers often guess at required environment variables and initial configuration.

## 4. Goals & Objectives

*   **Goal 1:** Establish a standardized, AI-guided process for comprehensive project definition and communication.
    *   **Objective 1.1:** Develop the **Wizard** module to guide users through creating detailed, AI-optimized PRDs containing all critical technical, functional, and UI/UX definitions.
    *   **Objective 1.2:** Enable easy sharing of the finalized PRD with all project stakeholders via a read-only web link.
*   **Goal 2:** Automate the creation of a clear, practical, and developer-ready development plan.
    *   **Objective 2.1:** Develop the **Agent** module to intelligently parse the rich PRD and generate a hierarchical set of SDLC tasks, including practical setup details.
    *   **Objective 2.2:** For v1.0, enable direct integration with Azure DevOps/GitHub for task creation, or provide an offline export option.
*   **Goal 3:** Create a persistent, interactive knowledge base to support active development (The Long-Term Vision for Post-v1.0).
    *   **Objective 3.1:** (Future) Develop the **Dev Assistant** module to act as a conversational interface to the project's "brain."

## 5. Target Audience/Users

*   **Primary User (Initiator):** Product Managers, Project Managers, Business Analysts, lead developers.
*   **Secondary User (Developer/Implementer):** Developers (human or AI) who consume the generated tasks and setup files.
*   **Tertiary User (Stakeholder):** Team members, clients, or executives who view the shared PRD for context and alignment.

## 6. Proposed Solution Overview

AIPAP1 is a web-based application with a project management layer and three core AI modules:

*   **Module 1 (Wizard - Plan):** Guides PRD creation. Facilitates the definition of technology stack and a comprehensive UI/UX Vision (theme, flows, principles). Can ingest existing documents and produces a final, sharable PRD.
*   **Module 2 (Agent - Deconstruct):** Ingests the Wizard's PRD. Parses requirements and generates a complete, hierarchical task list, including helper configurations. Syncs to DevOps tools or exports.
*   **Module 3 (Dev Assistant - Support - Future Vision):** A conversational AI layer for ongoing development support.
